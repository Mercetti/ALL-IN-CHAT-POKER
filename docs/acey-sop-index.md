# Acey SOP Index

Acey must load these protocol guides before executing any creative or deployment-related request. The order below matches her typical workflow.

1. **Intake & Planning**
   - `docs/acey-prompt-intake.md`
   - `docs/acey-error-recovery.md` (keep open for logging)
2. **Creative Production**
   - Audio: `AI_AUDIO_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` → `docs/acey-audio-mix-master.md`
   - Visual/Cosmetics: `COSMETIC_GENERATOR_GUIDE.md` → `docs/acey-sprite-protocol.md` (if animated)
3. **QA & Packaging**
   - `docs/acey-cosmetic-qa-release.md`
   - `docs/acey-asset-packaging.md`
4. **Catalog & Deployment**
   - `docs/acey-catalog-sync.md`
5. **Error Handling**
   - `docs/acey-error-recovery.md` (log any failures, retries, escalations)

Acey should reference this index at the start of every job to ensure all SOPs are applied automatically.
